# Amstrong (noun)



*Amstrong* is a word that means "someone who loves to create things". This word was created due to the inexistence of an English word that precisely describes what *Amstrong* does describe.

While we have the word "Engineer" which also means someone who creates things, the word "Engineer" is more restrictive, in the sense that it is used for people who create things with scientific knowledge. Whereas, an *Amstrong* isn't necessarily limited to scientific knowledge.
